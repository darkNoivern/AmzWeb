
I tried to make a replica of Amazon's Web page but a little different to brush up my learning 
in HTML5 , CSS3 , BOOTSTRAP5 

**  THINGS YOU SHOULD LOOK OUT FOR IN MY WEBSITE

    --  try " HOME , SIGN-IN , TOKEN " in the nav bars others are being worked upon 
    --  Stay a bit longer in HOME page to see the  " CAROUSEL " affect
    --  Hover over my nav Bars and the 3 floating boxes 
    --  the images in the boxes contain the links to other website you can check that
    --  go to sign-in page to see a normal bootstrap made page
    --  WOULD surely recommend seeing HOME  &  TOkens page 
    --  Tokens page not enough animations ig but the design will surely mesmerize

**  it's still under construction so other buttons in nav bar will not work 
**  also will improve the sign-in  &  tokens page in near future

HOME  :: 

**  Two nav bars for easy navigations (nice visual on hovering over it)  (Also has the Amazon logo studded)
**  Used " Carousel " Background effect (Using BOOTSTRAP 5)
**  3 floating boxes (opacity change on hovering )

My Improvements ::

**  I learned use of FLEX BOX and that helped in positioning the 3 boxes
**  I learned use of CSS GRIDS and used that to position and link the 4 images perfectly positioned

TOKEN :: 

**  3 floating boxes giving User A LOT OF NEW FEATURES
**  Great use of " Leetcode.png " to provide a great visual design 
**  input structure with a Redeem button

My realisation ::

**  I have to learn using more forms, labels and stuffs like that

SIGN-IN :: 

**  Full Structure (A-Z) is Made using BOOTSTRAP 5 

IMPROVEMENTS I WANNA MAKE

**  make webapage for other nav tabs and make a search bar
